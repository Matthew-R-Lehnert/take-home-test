## 1.	Deep Learning for Everyone (Theory Based Free Interactive Course)
### Course Marketing Description
Whether you are a complete noob, a seasoned data scientist, or a professional statistician; Deep Learning can seem completely foreign and even impossible.  In reality, Deep Learning has never been easier.  This course will deconstruct the myths of Deep Learning and set you up with a firm theoretical foundation for moving forward in your educational journey.  We will answer the questions of how Deep Learning differs from other approaches and talk about it's applications in a variety of domains including: image and speech recognition, natural language processing, predicting the future, fraud detection, advertising, medical applications, and even creating art.  Lastly, we will introduce you to the most popular deep learning frameworks and show you the basic components of a deep learning model.

## 2.	Deep Neural Networks in R
### Course Marketing Description
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are working behind the scenes of your everyday life.  From recommeding products for you to buy, classifying your favorite cat pictures, forecasting the weather, to predicting tomorrow's stock prices, DNNs are only getting more powerful.  With RStudio's creation of the Keras package it is now possible to deploy powerful DNNs within R.  After a broad discussion of DNNs, this course will introduce you to the basic layered architecture of Keras and teach you to build different models for classification and regression problems.

## 3.	Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM in R
### Course Marketing Description
Wouldn't it be nice if you could predict tomorrow's stock price of your favorite company?  Humanity has never been exposed to so much time-series data and tomorrow there will be even more!  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) offer a network architecture to solve time related problems.  In this course you will learn how to make RNNs and LSTMs and start predicting the future.

## 4.	Convolutional Neural Networks in R
### Course Marketing Description
Convolutional Neural Networks???  That sounds... **convoluted**!  Don't run!  In this course we will make convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seem easy.  Enroll today to enage with one of the most powerful architectures for image recognition.  Gambling at the race track you would want to know whether the animal was a horse or a donkey.  This course on CNNs will help you place your bets!
### Course Learning Objectives
## 5.	Generative Adversarial Networks in R
### Course Marketing Description
Did you know it is possible for a machine to create a cartoon character that you describe?  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) make this possible!  This course will teach you how researchers are using GANs to generate text, video, images, sound, and more! With hands on experience, you will gain the foundational layers to generate your own novel creations (or are they the AI's creations?). 
### Course Learning Objectives
## 6.	Transfer Learning and Pretrained Models in R
### Course Marketing Description
Are you short on data and computational power to implement your amazing AI idea?  Have no fear!  Transfer Learning is here! The popularity of deep learning has given birth to many open source pretrained models that will do a lot heavy lifting for you.  This course will introduce you to some of these models along with how to fine tune them to your specific problems.
