### Course Marketing Description
Wouldn't it be nice if you could predict tomorrow's stock price of your favorite company?  Humanity has never been exposed to so much time-series data, and tomorrow there will be even more!  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) offer a network architecture to solving time related problems.  In this course, you will learn how to make RNNs and LSTMs and start predicting the future.

## 5.	Generative Adversarial Networks in R
### Course Marketing Description
Did you know it is possible for a machine to create a cartoon character that you describe?  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) make this possible!  This course will teach you how researchers are using GANs to generate text, video, images, sound, and more! With hands on experience, you will gain the building blocks to generate your own novel creations (or are they the AI's creations?). 
### Course Learning Objectives
## 6.	Transfer Learning and Pretrained Models in R
### Course Marketing Description
Are you short on data and computational power to implement your amazing AI idea?  Have no fear!  Transfer Learning is here! The popularity of deep learning has given birth to many open source pretrained models that will do a lot heavy lifting for you.  This course will introduce you to some of these models along with how to fine tune them to your specific problems.
