# Deep Learning in R (Track Proposal)
## Track Marketing Description
In this track, you can start from zero knowledge of Deep Learning and build your way up to deploying high level AI.  Utilizing the powerful and easy to use Keras package, you will learn the most commonly used neural network architectures and deploy them in a multitude of different use cases.  This track is ideal for native R aficionados who want to learn cutting edge approaches to solving problems associated with classification, regression, time-series, image recognition, natural language processing, and more.  By the end of this track you will learn how to use neural networks to create art along with improving pre-existing neural networks developed by industry leaders.

## Track Learning Objectives

* Learner will be able to name common open source pretrained models

## Track Prerequisites
**Introduction to the Tidyverse**: The justification for this prerequisite is that RStudio's Keras package relies on the tidyverse framework.  Since the track will be utilizing the Keras package throughout the learner's journey, being familiar with the tidyverse will be essential.

**Author's note**:  That's it??  Yes.  I know the traditional line of thinking is that Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning and therefore the learner needs to know all about machine learning first.  For example, the Deep Learning in Python Track requires Supervised Learning with scikit-learn, and that course requires Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1), and that course has a prereq as well.  In my view, we should be building courses where they have the lowest barrier to entry.  Lastly, from an ontological point of view (sorry for the academic talk) I view supervised learning as having three entry points: parametric approaches (OLS, Logistic Regression, ARiMA, etc), low-cost-hyper-parametric approaches (RandomForest, XGBoost,etc.), and neural network approaches (DNNs, RNNs, CNNS, GANs, etc.).  My own historical learning path brought me in through the parametric approach (traditional statistics).  I have actually found myself (and my students) having to turn off a lot of my parametric brain and my low-cost-hyper-parametric brain in order to understand Deep Learning.
