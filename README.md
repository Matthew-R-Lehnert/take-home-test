# Datacamp Take-Home Test (Core Curriculum Manager)
#### **Applicant**: Matthew R. Lehnert
## Introduction
Datacamp assigned Matthew R. Lehnert a take-home test on 2/15/2021 as part of an ongoing application process.  The deliverables for the take-home test were three markdown files: **TrackProposal.md**, **CourseOutline.md**, and **SampleExercise.md**.  Below are three roadmaps followed to arrive at the deliverables, which had to be completed in four business days from when the test was assigned (2/19/2021).
## A. Create a Track Proposal (**complete**)
**Directions**: Create a track proposal in one of the following curriculum areas:
* Reporting
* Finance
* Programming
* **Deep Learning**
### Track Proposal Roadmap (**complete**)
1. Create 6-8 Courses (**complete**)
2. Track has clear learning objectives that would be relevant to a working professional in data science (**complete**)
3. Each proposed course has a brief marketing description that would engage a potential learner (**complete**)
4. Each proposed course has 2 - 3 specific, measurable learning objectives (**complete**)
5. Required prerequisites from DataCamp (if any are necessary) are clearly stated and briefly justified (**complete**)
6. The track outline is not reflective of an existing track (**complete**)
7. Save this proposal as TrackProposal.md in your GitHub repo (**complete**)

## B. Create a Course Outline (**complete**)
**Directions**: Create an outline of one of the courses you would include in your proposed track
### Course Outline Roadmap (**complete**)
1. Create four chapters, each with a descriptive name (**complete**)
2. Chapter 1 has three lessons and Chapters 2 - 4 have 3 or 4 lessons each (**complete**)
3. Each lesson has at least one specific, measurable learning objective (**complete**)
4. Each learning objective begins with “Learner will be able to...” and uses a verb from the vocab list (**complete**)
5. The ordering of lessons is optimized for learner engagement and narrative coherence (**complete**)
6. The course outline is sufficiently detailed to prove that the course will satisfy the learning objective stated in the proposed track (**complete**)
7. The course outline is not reflective of an existing course (**complete**)
8. The course can be completed in about 4 hours by a learner of appropriate skill level (**complete**)
9. Save this outline as CourseOutline.md in your Github repo (**complete**)

## C. Create a Sample Exercise (**complete**)
**Directions** Create a sample exercise for a lesson from your course outline. A sample exercise is a short code snippet (approximately 5 - 10 lines of code and 4 - 5 lines of code comments) with blanks that learners will fill in based on 2 - 4 bulleted instructions.
### Sample Exercise Roadmap (**complete**)
1. The exercise has 3 - 4 sentences of “Context” that engage the learner and explain why they are completing the exercise (**complete**)
2. The exercise has 2 - 4 bulleted instructions. Each instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task (usually a single line of code that the learner must write) (**complete**)
3. The solution code is no more than 15 lines of code (including 4 - 5 lines of code comments and any necessary line breaks) (**complete**)
4. The sample exercise assesses one or two measurable learning objectives (**complete**)
5. Save this exercise as SampleExercise.md in your GitHub repo (**complete**)
