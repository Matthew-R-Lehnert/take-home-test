# Datacamp Take-Home Test (Core Curriculum Manager)
#### **Applicant**: Matthew R. Lehnert
## Introduction
Datacamp assigned Matthew R. Lehnert a take-home test on 2/15/2021 as part of an ongoing application process.  The deliverables for the take-home test are three markdown files: **TrackProposal.md**, **CourseOutline.md**, and **SampleExercise.md**.  Below are three roadmaps followed to arrive at the deliverables, which had to be completed in four business days from when the test was assigned (2/19/2021).
## A. Create a Track Proposal
**Directions**: Create a track proposal in one of the following curriculum areas:
* Reporting
* Finance
* Programming
* Deep Learning
### Track Proposal Roadmap
1. Create 6-8 Courses (**complete**)
2. Track has clear learning objectives that would be relevant to a working professional in data science
3. Each proposed course has a brief marketing description that would engage a potential learner
4. Each proposed course has 2 - 3 specific, measurable learning objectives
5. Required prerequisites from DataCamp (if any are necessary) are clearly stated and briefly justified
6. The track outline is not reflective of an existing track
7. Save this proposal as TrackProposal.md in your GitHub repo

## B. Create Course Outline
**Directions**: Create an outline of one of the courses you would include in your proposed track
### Course Outline Roadmap
1. Create four chapters, each with a descriptive name
2. Chapter 1 has three lessons and Chapters 2 - 4 have 3 or 4 lessons each
3. Each lesson has at least one specific, measurable learning objective
4. Each learning objective begins with “Learner will be able to...” and uses a verb from the vocab list
5. The ordering of lessons is optimized for learner engagement and narrative coherence
6. The course outline is sufficiently detailed to prove that the course will satisfy the learning objective stated in the proposed track
7. The course outline is not reflective of an existing course
8. The course can be completed in about 4 hours by a learner of appropriate skill level
9. Save this outline as CourseOutline.md in your Github repo

## C. Create a Sample Exercise
**Directions** Create a sample exercise for a lesson from your course outline. A sample exercise is a short code snippet (approximately 5 - 10 lines of code and 4 - 5 lines of code comments) with blanks that learners will fill in based on 2 - 4 bulleted instructions.
### Course Outline Roadmap
1. The exercise has 3 - 4 sentences of “Context” that engage the learner and explain why they are completing the exercise
2. The exercise has 2 - 4 bulleted instructions. Each instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task (usually a single line of code that the learner must write)
3. The solution code is no more than 15 lines of code (including 4 - 5 lines of code comments and any necessary line breaks)
4. The sample exercise assesses one or two measurable learning objectives
5. Save this exercise as SampleExercise.md in your GitHub repo
